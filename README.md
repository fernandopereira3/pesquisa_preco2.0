Adaptation of the preco_search this time it can search for more than one product without the beatiful soup class.
More insistent and precise.

HOW TO USE:
Before using the Rocketry library used to automate the script, apparently there is a bug in Python 3.12, used to compile the script, so I used crontab for now.

1 - create a folder and place the WSCRAPY.PY file inside.
2 - then add the link wherever the price is tracked.
3 - the script will generate a data.csv file, initially saved in /home, after which it will follow the cheapest price of the desired product.

Improvements such as automation and email sending of data will be implemented as soon as I have more time ;)
