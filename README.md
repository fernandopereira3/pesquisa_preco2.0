## Details

This project was made for Black Friday 2023, I'm trying to buy another TV, done by reformulating the concept of the 'pequisa_preco' repository but this time the bot is implemented on an AWS EC2 and every 30 minutes it sends an email informing the lowest price found. Together with email, it generates a log where it stores all the prices collected in a txt file, I know it's not the best option but I'm not going to change it now, I'll correct it in future updates.
For now I'll leave it as is but in the near future I'll implement more products and perhaps incorporate Pandas to generate graphs.
